# World_Weather_Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of the project was to collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
### Resources
- Software: Jupyter Notebook, Version 2.27.21, Citipy, Version 0.0.5
      - Openweathermap.org
      - Google Developer
## Deliverables
The deliverables for this Challenge were as follows:

#### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

The objective was to generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data gathered in this module, retrieve the current weather description for each city and create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

Create a Weather_Database folder that contains the following:
  - Weather_Database.ipynb
  - WeatherPy_Database.csv
  
#### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map

Employ input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Show destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

Create a Vacation_Search folder that contains the following:
  - Vacation_Search.ipynb
  - WeatherPy_vacation.csv
  - WeatherPy_vacation_map.png
  
#### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations and create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.

Create a Vacation_Itinerary folder that contains the following:
  - Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb
  - WeatherPy_travel_map.png
  - WeatherPy_travel_map_markers.png
